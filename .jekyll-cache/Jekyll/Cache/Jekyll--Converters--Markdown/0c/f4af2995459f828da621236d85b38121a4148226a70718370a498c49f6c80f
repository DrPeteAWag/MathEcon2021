<h2 id="strategic-game">Strategic game</h2>

<p>A strategic game (with ordinal preferences) consists of</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a set of players</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for each player, a set of actions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for each player, preferences over the set of action profiles</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Very general model-no specific economic structure.</p>

<hr />
<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>firms competing for business</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>political candidates competing for votes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>jury members deciding on a verdict</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>animals fighting over prey</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>bidders competing in an auction</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the evolution of siblings‚Äô behavior towards each other - competing experts‚Äô incentives to provide correct diagnoses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>legislators‚Äô voting behavior under pressure from interest groups</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the role of threats and punishment in long-term relationships.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Notes on elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A player may be an individual human being, or any other decisionmaking entity like a government, a board of directors, the leadership of a revolutionary movement, or even a flower or an animal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no restrictions on the set of actions available to a player: may, for example, be a huge set containing complicated plans that cover a variety of contingencies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can represent preferences by payoff function.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Terminology: <strong>Action profile</strong> $=$ list of actions, one for each player</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h2 id="example-prisoners-dilemma">Example: Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma</h2>

<p>Strategic game:</p>

<p><strong>Players</strong> The two suspects.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong> Each player‚Äôs set of actions is {Quiet, Fink }.</p>

<p><strong>Preferences</strong> Suspect 1 ‚Äòs ordering of the action profiles, from best to worst, is (Fink, Quiet) (she finks and suspect 2 remains quiet, so she is freed), (Quiet, Quiet) (she gets one year in prison), (Fink, Fink) (she gets three years in prison), (Quiet, Fink) (she gets four years in prison). Suspect 2‚Äôs ordering is (Quiet, Fink), (Quiet, Quiet), (Fink, Fink), (Fink, Quiet).</p>

<hr />

<p>Choose payoff functions that represent preferences.</p>

\[\def\arraystretch{1.5}
\begin{array}{|c| c |c|}
\hline&amp; \text{Quiet}  (C)&amp; \text{Fink} (D)\\
\hline \text{ Quiet } (C) &amp; 2,2 &amp; 0,3 \\
\hline \text{ Fink }(D) &amp; 3,0 &amp; 1,1 \\
\hline
\end{array}\]

<p>Game models other situations: e.g. arms race, duopoly.</p>

<p><strong>Important point</strong>: game is defined by players‚Äô <em>preferences</em> (how they rank action profiles), not their <em>payoffs</em>. Hence, any game with different numbers but the same ranking over action profiles is also a prisoners‚Äô dilemma.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="example-battle-of-sexes-bos">Example: Battle of Sexes (BoS)</h2>

<p>In the Prisoner‚Äôs dilemma the players agree that $(C, C)$ is a desirable outcome, though each has an incentive to deviate from this outcome.</p>

<p>In BoS the players disagree about the outcome that is desirable.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Two people wish to go out together to a concert of music by either Bach or Stravinsky.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their main concern is to go out together, but one person prefers Bach and the other person prefers Stravinsky.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they go to different concerts then each of them is equally unhappy listening to the music of either composer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Choosing payoff representations, game is: 
\(\def\arraystretch{1.5}
\begin{array}{|r|c|c|}

\hline\text { Bach } &amp; 2,1 &amp; 0,0 \\
\hline\text { Stravinsky } &amp; 0,0 &amp; 1,2 \\
\hline
\end{array}\)</p>

<p><strong>Other interpretations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Two officials of a political party announcing a policy (better off if they announce same one).</li>
  <li>Merging firms that currently use different computer systems and need to choose the one to use after merging.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="example-guessing-two-thirds-of-the-average">Example: Guessing two-thirds of the average</h2>

<p>Game with <em>three</em> players where each player chooses a number between $1$ and $10$. One with number closest to $\frac{2}{3}$ of the average wins.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h2 id="nash-equilibrium">Nash equilibrium</h2>

<p>What actions will players take?</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Assume that each player acts rationally: chooses best action.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But best action depends on other players‚Äô actions. So a player must form a belief about the other players‚Äô actions.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Belief could come from introspection about what you would do in the other person‚Äôs shoes. But that‚Äôs NOT the approach used here (and leads to an infinite regress ‚Ä¶ ).</p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How are beliefs formed? Based on experience. 
  Experienced players $\Rightarrow$ correct beliefs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But players don‚Äôt interact repeatedly with the same opponents. Rather: random matching. [Think of walking along the street, meeting random people head-on and having to decide whether to step to the left or to the right.]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So: (a) each player chooses best action for her, given her beliefs about the other players‚Äô actions, and $(b)$ each player‚Äôs beliefs are correct.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A Nash equilibrium is an action profile $a^{<em>}$ with the property that no player $i$ can do better by choosing an action different from $a_{i}^{</em>}$, given that every other player $j$ adheres to $a_{j}^{*}$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In idealized setting in which the players in any given play of the game are drawn randomly from a collection of populations, a Nash equilibrium corresponds to a steady state.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nash equilibrium is alternatively stable ‚Äúsocial norm‚Äù.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The second component of the theory of Nash equilibrium-that the players‚Äô beliefs about each other‚Äôs actions are correct</li>
      <li>implies, in particular, that two players‚Äô beliefs about a third player‚Äôs action are the same. For this reason, the condition is sometimes referred to as the requirement that the players‚Äù ‚Äúexpectations are coordinated‚Äù.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>In applications, often idealized setting doesn‚Äôt fit! For example, in some cases the players do not have much experience with the game; in others they do not view each play of the game in isolation.</li>
  <li>Whether the notion of Nash equilibrium is appropriate in any given situation is a matter of judgment. In some cases, a poor fit with the idealized setting may be mitigated by other considerations.</li>
  <li>For example, inexperienced players may be able to draw conclusions about their opponents‚Äô likely actions from their experience in other situations, or from other sources. Ultimately, the test of the appropriateness of the notion of Nash equilibrium is whether it gives us insights into the problem at hand.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>DEFINITION</strong></p>

<p>The action profile $a^{<em>}$ in a strategic game with ordinal preferences is a Nash equilibrium if, for every player $i$ and every action $a_{i}$ of player $i, a^{</em>}$ is at least as good according to player $i^{\prime}$ s preferences as the action profile $\left(a_{i}, a_{-i}^{<em>}\right)$ in which player $i$ chooses $a_{i}$ while every other player $j$ chooses $a_{i}^{</em>}$. Equivalently, for every player $i$ 
\(u_{i}\left(a^{*}\right) \geq u_{i}\left(a_{i}, a_{-i}^{*}\right)\)
 for every action $a_{i}$ of player $i$ where $u_{i}$ is a payoff function that represents player $i^{\prime}$ s preferences.</p>

Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma, BoS,  Matching Pennies</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Stag Hunt</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A sentence in Discourse on the origin and foundations of inequality among men (1755) by the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau discusses group of hunters who wish to catch a stag.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They succeed if they all remain sufficiently attentive, but each is tempted to desert her post and catch a hare.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Model: Each of a group of hunters has two options: she may remain attentive to the pursuit of a stag, or she may catch a hare. If all hunters pursue the stag, they catch it and share it equally; if any hunter devotes her energy to catching a hare, the stag escapes, and the hare belongs to the defecting hunter alone. Each hunter prefers a share of the stag to a hare. The strategic game that corresponds to this specification is:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Players</strong> The hunters. (Note: Many players.)</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong> Each player‚Äôs set of actions is ${$ Stag, Hare $}$.</p>

<p><strong>Preferences</strong> For each player, the action profile in which all players choose Stag (resulting in her obtaining a share of the stag) is ranked highest, followed by any profile in which she chooses Hare (resulting in her obtaining a hare), followed by any profile in which she chooses Stag and one or more of the other players chooses Hare (resulting in her leaving empty-handed).</p>

<p>Like other games with many players, this game cannot easily be presented in a table like that in Figure $1 .$ For the case in which there are two hunters, the game is as follows:</p>

<hr />

\[\def\arraystretch{1.5}
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} 
\hline&amp;\text { Stag } &amp;\text { Hare } \\
\hline\text { Stag } &amp; 2,2 &amp; 0,1 \\
\hline\text { Hare } &amp; 1,0 &amp; 1,1 \\
\hline
\end{array}\]

<hr />

<p><strong>Nash equilibrium</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Inspection shows that the two-player Stag Hunt has two Nash equilibria: (Stag, Stag) and (Hare,Hare).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Unlike the Nash equilibria of BoS, one of these equilibria is better for both players than the other: each player prefers (Stag, Stag) to (Hare, Hare).</li>
  <li>This fact has no bearing on the equilibrium status of (Hare, Hare), since the condition for an equilibrium is that a single player cannot gain by deviating, given the other player‚Äôs behavior.</li>
  <li>Put differently, an equilibrium is immune to any unilateral deviation; coordinated deviations by groups of players are not contemplated.</li>
  <li>However, the existence of two equilibria raises the possibility that one equilibrium might more likely be the outcome of the game than the other.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>First nontrivial argument</strong>:</p>

<p>I argue that the many-player Stag Hunt also has two Nash equilibria: the action profile $($ Stag,$\ldots$, Stag $)$ in which every player joins in the pursuit of the stag, and the profile (Hare,‚Ä¶, Hare) in which every player catches a hare.</p>

<ul>
  <li>$($ Stag,$\ldots$, Stag $)$ is a Nash equilibrium because each player prefers this profile to that in which she alone chooses Hare.</li>
  <li>(Hare, ‚Ä¶, Hare) is a Nash equilibrium because each player prefers this profile to that in which she alone pursues the stag.</li>
  <li>No other profile is a Nash equilibrium, because in any other profile at least one player chooses Stag and at least one player chooses Hare, so that any player choosing Stag is better off switching to Hare.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>We now study a model in which TWO people decide not only whether to contribute, but also how much to contribute. More contributions $\Rightarrow$ more of good is provided.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Person i‚Äôs wealth: $w_{i} .$ Amount she contributes to public good: $c_{i}$ $\left(0 \leq c_{i} \leq w_{i}\right)$. (She spends her remaining wealth $w_{i}-c_{i}$ on ‚Äúprivate goods $^{\prime \prime} .$.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amount of public good $=$ sum of contributions. Each person cares both about the amount of the public good and her consumption of private goods.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Person $i^{\prime}$ s preferences represented by $v_{i}\left(c_{1}+c_{2}\right)+w_{i}-c_{i}\left(c_{1}+c_{2}=\right.$ amount of public good; $w_{i}-c_{i}=$ amount of private good; $v_{i}$ is a funtion!). Function is quasi-linear.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because $w_{i}$ is a constant, person $i$ ‚Äòs preferences are alternatively represented by the payoff function [leave on board, for later use]</p>
  </li>
</ul>

\[u_{i}\left(c_{1}, c_{2}\right)=v_{i}\left(c_{1}+c_{2}\right)-c_{i}\]

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>This situation is modeled by the following strategic game.</li>
</ul>

<p>Players The two people.</p>

<p>Actions Player i‚Äôs set of actions is the set of her possible contributions (nonnegative numbers less than or equal to $\left.w_{i}\right)$, for $i=1,2$.</p>

<p>Preferences Player i‚Äôs preferences are represented by the payoff function $u_{i}$ given in (1), for $i=1,2$.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nash equilibrium: Player $1^{\prime} \mathrm{s}$ best response to the contribution $c_{2}$ of player 2 is the value of $c_{1}$ that maximizes $v_{1}\left(c_{1}+c_{2}\right)-c_{1} .$ Without specifying the form of the function $v_{1}$ we cannot explicitly calculate this optimal value. However, we can determine how it varies with $c_{2}$.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Book finds equilibria using elementary means. Probably easier with calculus: - Player 1‚Äôs payoff is $v_{1}\left(c_{1}+c_{2}\right)-c_{1}$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix $c_{2}$. Then $b_{1}\left(c_{2}\right)$ solves</p>
  </li>
</ul>

\[\max _{c_{1}}\left[v_{1}\left(c_{1}+c_{2}\right)-c_{1}\right]\]

<ul>
  <li>Suppose payoff function is concave in $c_{1}$, with an interior maximum. Then look at FOC:</li>
</ul>

\[v_{1}^{\prime}\left(b_{1}\left(c_{2}\right)+c_{2}\right)-1=0\]

<hr />

<p>That means that $b_{1}\left(c_{2}\right)+c_{2}$ is constant, independent of $c_{2} !$ Thus</p>

\[b_{1}\left(c_{2}\right)=K-c_{2}\]

<p>for some $K$, where $b_{1}(0)=K$.</p>

<p>Draw the function $b_{1} .$ See Figure 4 .</p>

<ul>
  <li>$v_{2}$ may be different from $v_{1}$, so $b_{1}(0) \neq b_{2}(0) .$ But both best response functions have same slope of $-1$ (shown in Figure 4 for $\left.b_{1}(0)&gt;b_{2}(0)\right)$.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>SO: if $b_{1}(0)&gt;b_{2}(0)$, game has unique Nash equilibrium, $\left(b_{1}(0), 0\right)$ and if $b_{1}(0)&lt;b_{2}(0)$, unique Nash equilibrium $\left(0, b_{2}(0)\right)$. That is, the person who contributes more when the other person contributes nothing is the only one to make a contribution in a Nash equilibrium. Only if $b_{1}(0)=b_{2}(0)$, which is not likely if the functions $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ differ, is there an equilibrium in which both people contribute. In this case the downward-sloping parts of the best response functions coincide, so that any pair of contributions $\left(c_{1}, c_{2}\right)$ with $c_{1}+c_{2}=b_{1}(0)$ and $c_{i} \geq 0$ for $i=1,2$ is a Nash equilibrium.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>Summary: Nash equilibrium predicts that, except in unusual circumstances, only one person contributes to the provision of the public good when each person‚Äôs payoff function takes the form $v_{i}\left(c_{1}+c_{2}\right)+$ $w_{i}-c_{i}$, each function $v_{i}\left(c_{i}\right)-c_{i}$ increases to a maximum, then decreases, and each person optimally contributes less than her entire wealth when the other person does not contribute. The person who contributes is the one who wishes to contribute more when the other person does not contribute. In particular, the identity of the person who contributes does not depend on the distribution of wealth; any distribution in which each person optimally contributes less than her entire wealth when the other person does not contribute leads to the same outcome.</li>

  <li>
    <p>A player‚Äôs action ‚Äústrictly dominates‚Äù another action if it is superior, no matter what the other players do:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In a strategic game with ordinal preferences, player $i$ ‚Äòs action $a_{i}^{\prime \prime}$ strictly dominates her action $a_{i}^{\prime}$ if</p>

<p>$u_{i}\left(a_{i}^{\prime \prime}, a_{-i}\right)&gt;u_{i}\left(a_{i}^{\prime}, a_{-i}\right)$ for every list $a_{-i}$ of the other players‚Äô actions,</p>

<p>where $u_{i}$ is a payoff function that represents player i‚Äôs preferences. We say that the action $a_{i}^{\prime}$ is strictly dominated.</p>

<hr />

  <li>
    <p>a strictly dominated action is not used in any Nash equilibrium</p>

</ul>

<p>First eliminate $T$ for player 1, then $C$ for player 2, then $B$ for player 1, then $L$ for player 2. [Note C, e.g., is not strictly dominated in original game.] Figure 5 .</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>NOTE: in guessing $2 / 3$ of the average game actions are not iteratively dominated by pure strategies, so can‚Äôt use this example now.</p>

<h2 id="experiment-guessing-two-thirds-of-the-average">Experiment: Guessing two-thirds of the average</h2>

<p>Note: this experiment corresponds to a single population steady state (for simplicity, because of symmetry of game).</p>

<p>Three players choose numbers. One with number closest to $\frac{2}{3}$ of the average wins.</p>

<p>Precisely:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Players: ${1,2,3}$</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Actions: ${1,2, \ldots, 10}$</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Payoffs: Let $g(a)=\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \sum_{i=1}^{10} a_{i}\left(2 / 3\right.$ of average). If $\left</td>
          <td>a_{i}-g(a)\right</td>
          <td>&lt;$ $\left</td>
          <td>a_{j}-g(a)\right</td>
          <td>$ for all $j \neq i, i$ s payoff is $1 .$ Deal with ties $\ldots$</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>[Note that unique equilibrium, $(1,1,1)$, is only strategy profile that survives successive elimination of weakly dominated strategies. If number of players is small (e.g. 3, as in exercise in book), smallest of three announced numbers is often the closest to $\frac{2}{3}$ of average, and thus wins. So players may deduce that they should play a small number, for not quite the right reason. To avoid this, could use more players (e.g. 5?).]</p>

<hr />

<p>Explain game. Give example: for $(3,2,8)$ the average is $\frac{13}{3}$, so $\frac{2}{3}$ of average is $2 \frac{8}{9}$. Thus winner is player 1 (who named 3). For $(3,1,5)$, average is 3 , so $\frac{2}{3}$ of average is 2, so players 1 and 2 are joint winners.</p>

<p>Pay $$ 5$ to the group with highest average payoff (total payoff divided by number of times the group played).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Divide class into 10 groups - Give each group a set of 10 cards, numbered 1 to 10 (with group numbers in red)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Load the APLII workspace guessavg and run the program play. (A file of the choices will be written to the file specified in the $\backslash x y \backslash m \backslash$ courses $\backslash 326$ directory.) The number of participants is the number of groups. The program is currently written for 3 players.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Or: in each round, generate a triple of numbers from 1 to 10 (the number of groups) randomly. These are the three groups who play in the round.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The players in each round simultaneously show one of their cards.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get an assistant to record the players in the round and their choices; the winning choice can be circled.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Repeat for several rounds.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If get convergence to $(1,1,1):$ can see that $(1,1,1)$ is a Nash equilibrium. Why is no other action profile a Nash equilibrium?</p>

<hr />

<p>Discussion: Note that 1 is not the best action to use for every list of actions of the other players. E.g. if the others name 1 and 10, naming 1 yields $\frac{1}{2}$ whereas naming 2 yields $1 .$</p>

<p>Note that in the game actions can be iteratively eliminated.</p>

<p>What would happen if the game were to guess the average, rather than $2 / 3$ of the average? [Multiple equilibria-as Keynes suggested for the stock market.] (Exercise/exam question? Could play that game too.)</p>
