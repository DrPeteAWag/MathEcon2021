**Extensive games: Motivation**

We start with some motivating examples of games with sequential moves; the familiar game tick-tack-toe and a second game, removing coins. The goal is to get a sense for the types of strategic interactions we are interested in and to motivate the definition of extensive games in the next video.

**Extensive games: Definition**

The next videos provides a (relatively) formal definition of extensive games, and it discusses the notion of strategies and outcomes in extensive games, which are more complicated objects than in simple strategic games.

**Nash equilibria of Extensive Games**

The next video discusses Nash equilibria of extensive games. The basic notion of Nash equilibrium is the same as before: no player has a profitable deviation! But since strategies are a bit more complicated, it takes a little bit more effort to understand what Nash equilibria in extensive games are, and how to find them.

**Subgame Perfect Equilibrium**


The Nash equilibrium has the problem that it allows outcomes that are sustained by "empty threats". This video explains what this means, and discusses an equilibrium refinement called the subgame perfect equilibrium that removes equilibria that entail such empty threats. The video also describes how to find subgame perfect equilibria in finite game through the process of backwards induction.

The next three videos provide examples to illustrate the previous points in slightly more involved settings.
