title: "Week 4: Extensive games with incomplete information"
---


### Lecture Videos
We now move on to extensive games with incomplete information. These games are equivalent to extensive games with imperfect information (unobserved *actions*, rather than unobserved *types*) and “chance” moves by nature, and we will talk about such games only in these terms. The main difference to Bayesian games is that players move sequentially and learn during the game, and the challenge is then to model how players learn and what beliefs they hold at each stage of the game. 

1. In the [first video](https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/viewer.aspx?id=87d666ec-439d-45d6-8318-acc1015c310f), I provide a motivating example that illustrates the kind of challenges that we encounter when dealing with extensive games with incomplete information.  In particular, I point to two new requirements that will lie at the heart of the equilibrium notion that we will need for such games: sequential rationality and belief consistency. 
1. In the [second video](https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/viewer.aspx?id=4fdf9e2c-0daf-4261-b3ff-acc1015c3b0c)), I define and discuss the notion of “sequential rationality”. 
1. In the [third video](https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/viewer.aspx?id=1cd283ed-af17-467b-b77d-acc1015c431b), I define and discuss the notion of “belief consistency”. 
1. The [fourth video](https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=bbfea946-4c8c-4d7c-8a3f-acc5009efe9c)[ ](https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=bbfea946-4c8c-4d7c-8a3f-acc5009efe9c)provides a general definition of weak perfect Bayesian equilibrium, and I provide some context and illustrate one of its weaknesses with an example. 
1. The last two videos provide examples of extensive games with incomplete information
   1. [Example  1](https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/viewer.aspx?id=eb65d576-fd18-409c-9863-acc10164e492): “Card Game”
   1. [Example  2](https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/viewer.aspx?id=0b5094f9-8d45-4f5e-b49f-acc10169f242): “Spence’s Signalling game”
