### Lecture Videos
This week, we will be focusing our attention on a review of some basic concepts from probability theory and statistics. To view the videos in full screen, open them in a new tab. 

1. In my [first](https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=70b79d00-fe67-42bb-a082-acb3013da51b )[ ](https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=70b79d00-fe67-42bb-a082-acb3013da51b )[video](https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=70b79d00-fe67-42bb-a082-acb3013da51b ) (link), I review the notions of probability distributions, discrete and continuous random variables, and expectation. 
1. In my [second](https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=dda0d5a6-37c3-47c4-8a43-acb3015a1aa5)[ ](https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=dda0d5a6-37c3-47c4-8a43-acb3015a1aa5)[video](https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=dda0d5a6-37c3-47c4-8a43-acb3015a1aa5) (link), I revisit the notion of conditional probability, and Bayesâ€™ rule and  independence. 
1. In the [third](https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d5d7e4ab-93db-44ac-8262-acb30166776b)[ ](https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d5d7e4ab-93db-44ac-8262-acb30166776b)[video](https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d5d7e4ab-93db-44ac-8262-acb30166776b), I then explain how we use these concepts to incorporate random draws into decision problems, which we will later extend to game theoretic settings.

1. If you feel like you would like to have a more basic review of these concepts, take a look at the lesson in [Khan](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/random-variables-stats-library/random-variables-discrete/v/random-variables)[ ](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/random-variables-stats-library/random-variables-discrete/v/random-variables)[academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/random-variables-stats-library/random-variables-discrete/v/random-variables)[ ](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/random-variables-stats-library/random-variables-discrete/v/random-variables)[here](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/random-variables-stats-library/random-variables-discrete/v/random-variables).
